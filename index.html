                <h2>Does Gender Influence Chosen Majors?</h2>
                Now what if we took those same categories, but coloured them based on the proportion of the students which are male or female? 
                In this chart, blue represents majors with > 60% male, and red represents > 60% female, and the grey bubbles represent the more gender 
                balanced courses.
                <br><br>(Hover over the labels if you've forgotten the category)<br><br>

                What is striking about this graphic is that almost every category grouping of majors are either decidedly more female-weighted or male-weighted,
                with the exception of perhaps the business and physical sciences majors.  
                </p>

            <section class="step">
                When we plot the % of students in a major being female against the median salary of students in the major, a fairly clear trend emerges. 
                It appears that majors with a higher proportion of male students also produce students with higher median wages. <br><br> In fact, a linear model
                would predict that for every added percentage of female students in a given major, the median annual salary drops by $306 USD.

                So we've seen the most 'profitable' majors, as well as the ones with the most uneven gender distributions. But what are students 
                actually enrolling in the most frequently? What can enrolment numbers tell us about actual interest in each major? This chart has the bubbles 
                sized based on the number of students enrolled in each major, and coloured by category. 
                <svg id = 'legend3' width = '400px' height = '350px'></svg>
                Psychology is the clear leader in this regard, with over 390,000 students enrolled. Business related topics such as general business, business management,
                accounting and finance are all also heavily enrolled.

                    Hopefully, this has helped you in deciding what major you hope to study. If you want to take a deeper look into the data for yourself, you can download
